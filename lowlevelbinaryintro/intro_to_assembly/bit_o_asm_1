Description
Can you figure out what is in the eax register? Put your answer in the picoCTF flag format: picoCTF{n} where n is the contents of the eax register in the decimal number base. If the answer was 0x11 your flag would be picoCTF{17}.

attempts:
<+15>:    mov    eax,0x30
line from this file, seems like 0x30 is in eax register

picoCTF{48} is the answer
