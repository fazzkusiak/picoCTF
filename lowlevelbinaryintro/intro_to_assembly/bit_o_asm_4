Description
Can you figure out what is in the eax register? Put your answer in the picoCTF flag format: picoCTF{n} where n is the contents of the eax register in the decimal number base. If the answer was 0x11 your flag would be picoCTF{17}.

<+15>:    mov    DWORD PTR [rbp-0x4],0x9fe1a
<+22>:    cmp    DWORD PTR [rbp-0x4],0x2710
<+29>:    jle    0x55555555514e <main+37>
<+31>:    sub    DWORD PTR [rbp-0x4],0x65
<+35>:    jmp    0x555555555152 <main+41>
<+37>:    add    DWORD PTR [rbp-0x4],0x65
<+41>:    mov    eax,DWORD PTR [rbp-0x4]


this is what are we looking for i think

so, compare doesn't allow just to jump, so we just make one subraction, and then we are reading the register value
picoCTF{654773}
