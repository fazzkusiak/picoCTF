In this playlist, we present Mochi’s Tale, a videogame that will whet your appetite for the low level code challenges presented in this playlist. We’ll introduce assembly, debuggers and some Python code that can be exploited in similar ways as assembly code. After completing this playlist, we hope you’ll feel prepared to take on some more challenges in the Reverse Engineering and Binary Exploitation category.
