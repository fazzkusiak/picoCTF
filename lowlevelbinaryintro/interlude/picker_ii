Description
Can you figure out how this program works to get the flag?
Connect to the program with netcat:
$ nc saturn.picoctf.net 59829
The program's source code can be downloaded here.

there is the function

def win():
  # This line will not work locally unless you create your own 'flag.txt' in
  #   the same directory as this script
  flag = open('flag.txt', 'r').read()
  #flag = flag[:-1]
  flag = flag.strip()
  str_flag = ''
  for c in flag:
    str_flag += str(hex(ord(c))) + ' '
  print(str_flag)
  
  
however we are unable to get access to it according to filtres, so we have python console, we can for example print the variable, like as

print(open('flag.txt', 'r').read()

which gives us flag
